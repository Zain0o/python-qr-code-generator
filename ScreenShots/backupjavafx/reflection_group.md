Group Reflection: Quality of group reflection on teamwork, role
distribution, and collaborative process; approximately 2-3
paragraphs; additionally include member name/effort weight

5 points

As a team, we collaborated effectively and completed tasks in a timely manner. We worked in pairs or 
trios focused on related areas, which allowed us to develop high-quality code while supporting one 
another through regular peer review. For example, Tom and Zain worked closely on matrix creation and 
masking, Ahmed and Nolan on data encoding and error correction, and Akin and Zain on the GUI and web interface. This 
structure allowed members to stay focused on their responsibilities while seeking guidance or reviews 
from their group partners as needed.

Ahmed and Tom took on the primary responsibility of assigning tasks and reviewing merge requests, 
helping maintain consistent code quality and functionality across the project. Meanwhile, Akin, Nolan, 
and Zain provided targeted reviews within their respective domains to ensure algorithmic accuracy and 
proper integration. During the transition from Version 1 to Version 2, we reassigned work while keeping 
members within similar technical areas, leveraging existing familiarity with the codebase. This 
continuity contributed to better efficiency and fewer integration issues.

Throughout the project, we maintained open communication via group discussions and regular check-ins, 
which helped surface and resolve blockers early. We ensured that each member had both ownership and 
support, balancing individual contribution with team alignment.

Effort weights:
Ahmed: 100%
Tom: 100%
Zain: 100%
Nolan: 100%
Akin: 100%
