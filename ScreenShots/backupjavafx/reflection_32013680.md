My Contribution focused on developing the encode_byte_mode(data: str) function, which was responsible for encoding data into ISO-8859-1 format for QR code generation. This included integrating padding, terminators and producing list of 8-bit codewords for matrix construction. 
I also ensured the project documentation adhered to QR pipeline standards. 
Initially, I was apprehensive, as this was my first substantial coding project involving use of collaborative tools like GitLab and Code spaces. The wide project scope and unfamiliar coordination methods poses early challenges, particularly when it came to task distribution through fair means. 
A key strength was translating theoretical concepts from resources like the Thonky QR guide into a working implementation. 
Additionally, structuring my approach to planning by defining tasks, goals and buffers ensured alignment with deadlines and allowed for effective debugging and iteration.   Undergoing this project helped me to apply core Python principles for exception handling whilst engaged deeply with QR standards. 
It also improved my ability to assess and integrate peer contributions efficiently. Undergoing my next project, I plan for more cohesive edge case testing and adopting further peer reviews. This will support my code to being more robust and improve team wide integration and reliability across the development pipeline.
