I was responsible for designing the V1 and V2 matrix layout and patterns, the automatic selection 
algorithm, and also for managing task allocations and PR reviews. A difficult challenge I faced was 
integrating the created QR with the matrix_masking.py module and the final display in app.py. We
eventually overcame this challenge through rigorous testing and debugging. All in all, I have bettered 
my understanding not only in maintaining a high level of code quality, but also the value of teamwork. 

I contributed to several modules, most notably matrix_layout.py. In matrix_layout.py, I implemented 
multiple core functions responsible for the structural components of a QR code, such as functions to 
create finder patterns, separators, and other function patterns. In matrix_masking.py, I developed a 
the key function responsible for selecting the masking pattern with the best penalty score, which was 
later integrated into app.py. I adhered strictly to snake_case naming conventions and provided clear, concise docstrings for each 
function. I ensured that each function had a single responsibility and could be easily tested and 
maintained.
